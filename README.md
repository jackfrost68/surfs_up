# Overview of the statistical analysis:
I'm planning launch a Surf n' Shake shop in Hawaii. To get initial capital to start the business, I seek an investor who earlier invested in a similar business. He mentioned it failed due to not factoring weather in the city that the shop was stationed in. Therefore, he advises me to use my analytical skills to better understand the weather patterns in Oahu and how they might impact my business. Using SQL Lite and Python, I analyse weather data from a local weather dataset. 

# Results:

* The average temperature in June was approximately 75 degress while it was 71 degrees in December.
* The minimum temperature in June was approximately 64 degress while it was 56 degrees in December.
* The maximum temperature in June was approximately 85 degress while it was 83 degrees in December.

Below are more statistical details for temperatures in the months of June and December ;

# Summary:
Based on these results, one can deduce that ice-cream sales in June are likely to superceed those in Decemeber due to warmer temperatures, and thus can stock up more inventory in advance.
