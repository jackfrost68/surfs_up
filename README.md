# Overview of the statistical analysis:
I'm planning launch a Surf n' Shake shop in Hawaii. To get initial capital to start the business, I seek an investor who earlier invested in a similar business. He mentioned it failed due to not factoring weather in the city he stationed his shop. Therefore, he advises me to use my analytical skills to better understand the weather patterns in Oahu and how they might impact my business. Using SQL Lite and Python, I analyse weather data from a local weather dataset.
