# Overview of the statistical analysis:
Tom, an employee of the Colorado Board of Elections, and I developed python code to audit their recent election's tabulated results. We were tasked with reporting the total number of votes, votes per candidate, percentage of votes per candidate, as well as the winner of the election based on the popular vote. The benefit of using python to verfiy the results is that it could be automated and hopefully used in other cogressional or senatorial districts.
